This project is for the Web Design and Development 4COSCO11C coursework. The goal is to create a website called IT Master that includes various web development-related features implemented by different students.

## Project Details

The IT Master website includes the following features developed by different students:

1. **Presentation Page** (Student 1 - Presentation Page): A presentation page with the title and the names of everyone in the group. After 4 seconds, a second page will be displayed (Main Web page).
2. **Main Page** (Student 2 - Main Page): The main home page designed by the group, providing a base for consistency for the rest of the website. The main page includes buttons styled as links with hover effects.
3. **Query Form** (Student 2 - Query Form): A form to send a query related to the website content. The form includes input fields for user details, a textarea for query details, a selection of query themes, and a "view query" button. JavaScript is used to validate the form and display a summary of the query before sending it by email.
4. **Buy Products** (Student 1 - Buy products): A form to allow users to buy products related to the website topic. The form includes personal details, product selection with quantity, and dynamically calculates the total price. JavaScript validation is used to ensure required fields are filled before displaying an invoice-like summary.

8. **Student Details** (Student 3 - Student details): A page with pictures of the group members. When the user hovers over a picture, the member's details (name and role) are displayed.
9. **Consistency of Style**: The website maintains consistency of style using a unique external style sheet file for the main page and navigation, applied throughout the website.
10. **Additional Content Page**: An additional content page related to the website topic, featuring anchor links within the page for easy navigation.
